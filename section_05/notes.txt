Classes & Instances

Objects 
 - What you work with: {}
 - Instances of Classes (Based on Classes)
 - Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals

Classes
 - "Blueprints for objects" (theoretical definition)
 - Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
 - Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier
